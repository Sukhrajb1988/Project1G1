Apple's Earnings (Earnings Per Share Analysis) - by Marlene Holman

The comparison of Basic vs Diluted are shown on the first graph. There is no significant difference but I take the Diluted value for my analysis as Diluted EPS accounts for all potential dilution that could occur from stock-based compensation, warrants, convertible securities, and other dilutive instruments.

On my second graph, I ploted the % change of EPS and showed a big increase and decrease. There are more positive increase than negative. 

My 3rd graph shows comparison analysis of EPS Diluted compared to Adj Close of stock data. The data are close relative to price until it hit 2020 where the Adj Close started to take off until the data of 2022. 

And finally, I did an r value test which shows a negative colleration. This shows that there are no direct relation of Adj Close to EPS. This inverse correlation though enables investors to diversify their portfolios. EPS has more factors to consider other thatn Adj Close like product launches and expenses.
