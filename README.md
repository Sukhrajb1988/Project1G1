Project 1 - Min Young (Clare) Kim's Analysis on Samsung vs. Aplle 

Apple and Samsung Stock prices from 2009 to 2022 both have similar upward trends, and a spike during COVID and then eventually fizzling out from 2021, 2022. R-value is 0.89, which indicates that there is a strong positive correlation between Samsung stock prices and Apple stock prices. Because there are so many other factors that affect the correlation, this r-value needs furthe exploration. 

I then decided to look at the correlation of stock prices in 2019 in respect to their product launches. 

Looking at the first quarter of 2019 from January to March, while Samsung’s product launch does not have significant impact on its own stock price as well as impact on Apple’s stock price, Apple’s product launch does seem to have a visible impact on its own stock price and Samsung’s stock price. Apple’s stock price begins to skyrocket 2 weeks before the launch, and Samsung’s stock price falling during the same period. 

I decided to also look at the third quarter of 2019 from July to September. Because Galaxy Fold was Samsung’s big reveal of the year, I wanted to see whether Galaxy Fold launch would have any impact on Apple’s stock price. According to the graph, while Samsung’s stock price does go up a little right before and after the Fold’s reveal, Apple stock price also goes up, which indicates that Apple stock price doesn’t seem to have much to do with how Samsung is doing. 

To sum up, both stock prices increased for the past 10+ years, and while that may in first glance seem like there’s a positive correlation between the two, there are many third variables that may be driving the increase. Also, seemingly, Apple’s product launch has greater impact on its own stock price as well as on the competitor’s stock price than Samsung does. This suggests that investors are not taking sides and putting their money on either one of them, but they are probably investing in both whenever new innovative products come out, but considering Apple’s stock price and the responsiveness of the stock price towards product launches, consumers seem to be paying more attention and investing more in Apple than Samsung.
